Conway's Game of Life
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

Implementation in Java by Kevin Guerra

Application is provided for a technical test for Chase Manhattan bank.

Uses Java swing library for graphics
Engine is separate from the gui so it can be tested and profiled independently

Features:
- Step manually
- Continuous stepping via thread
- Step, Play and Stop menu
- Selectable stepping speed
- Selectable (in code)
  a) cell and grid colors
  b) cell teleporting to opposite side, or cell confinement to the grid, teleport is default, because of fun factor
  c) cell can be a circle or square
- Resizable window, affects grid size, can be done while executing
- Random grid fill, to more easily experiment
- Input cell configuration via command line or input box


Implementation:
- Engine uses double buffer, sacrificing space in favor of speed, and also in favor of
  less memory allocation and deallocation
- Neighboring cells are precalculated during resizing
- Both buffers reference the same neighbors data, even in different arrays, to keep a smaller memory footprint
- The resizing function causes recalculation of double buffers, and only there is memory resized
- The stepping function does not have any memory allocation or deallocation
- The code was written in eclipse IDE
- Testing the code requires eclipse with JUnit

Bugs:
- Currently there appear to be some occasional refresh bugs, during resizing
- Somewhat rarely the gui will freeze preventing you from setting cells, stopping the game has no effect, only
  an application restart
  
SAMPLE:
java -jar gol.jar ..........n...0......n....0.....n..000.....n..........n..........n..........n..........n..........
invokes a grid of 10x9 with a 'walker'
